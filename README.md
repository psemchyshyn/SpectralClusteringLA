# Spectral Partitioning on Image

### Semester project from Linear Algebra course @ UCU 2021

## Description

This is a repository that refers to the program in Google Colab that breaks up image into a several single-colored clusters.

## Implementation and Examples

The program uses KNN algorithm, Laplacian matrix and eigenvalues/vectors, so you have to be at least a little acknowledged about these. The approach, math part, and examples 
are all included into the report that can be found in this repo.

## Link

The Google Colab link is [HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H6kpGkagRLMFJXx9NGV90Sg8YLq8GnBv?authuser=1#scrollTo=TID8WKj9QlM_)! It should be automatically open to everyone from
